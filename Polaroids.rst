Description
===========
In mid 2012, I became fascinated with the Polaroid SX-70. The camera is a folding SLR, and when released in 1972, it was Polaroid's first integral film camera. My first exposure to the SX-70 was `this video <https://youtu.be/Lo_1pyQ7xvc>`_, in which it just seems so marvelous.

Then, there is the story of `Jamie Livingston <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Livingston>`_. His photo a day project brought him from `1979 to 1997 <http://photooftheday.hughcrawford.com/>`_, with around 6,700 photographs. So, some combination of my interest in Jamie's story, and the technology of the camera, led me to purchase my own.

=================
The polaroids often find their way into other works, or form the basis of entirely new projects.

Polaroid Timelapse Videos
-------------------------
Embedded below is an example from a set of Polaroid timelapse development videos. This project was focused on observing the film's chemical conversion, and rendering that as a digital process. The resulting videos are just slow enough to lose track of what exactly is shifting in between each individual frame. In the case of images which were over-exposed, the development process gradually gains then loses detail before developing to completion.

NOPE Images
-----------
In a rare experiment with negation (instead of affirmation), the NOPE images are a set of pictures that have been taken with a thin plastic slide hidden inside the camera. The plastic slide has a single word printed on it, which is imprinted onto an over-exposed image as it is being taken.
