# What is This?

This is an archive of my recent artworks, organized by type. The purpose being to document the basic info about them, as well as some technical details of the work. This information, along with some photos and a concise description, hopefully provides a good introduction to how the work could be installed in a gallery setting.

For those interested, the pages also include links to the source files (often code and 3D printer files) where available.
