## Description
This performance was part of an exhibition at Georgian College in Barrie, Ontario. This artwork deals with a favorite area of focus: how can feelings of nostalgia and novelty subvert the viewer's expectations of an object or experience. Things such as a rotary phone, a FM radio, and a bicycle are all present, but nothing quite works as it should: the phones only play stories, the radio's only loop static and local audio piped in form the phones, and the bike is just there to blow-up a balloon.

The exhibition takes a humorous and strange set of objects, and places them a bit closer to a personal context: these things that I made for you.
